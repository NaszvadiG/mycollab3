*Title: Can I preview audio and video files in activeCollab?
*Slug: audio-video-preview

================================================================

All standard image files can be previewed in activeCollab. If you upload a <{term}>PNG<{/term}> file, for example, you will be able to see the image in activeCollab without having to download the file to your computer.  The <{option}>Quick View<{/option}> tool will appear as a  "blinking eye" icon whenever you hover over the image. Clicking the icon will preview the image.

**You can also preview your audio and video files**. All you have to do is to <{page name="upload-files-and-attachments"}>upload a New File<{/page}> and you will be able to play it right from activeCollab.
