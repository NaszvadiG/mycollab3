================================================================

Sometimes you may need to send a File stored in activeCollab to a client or to show some of your work to a colleague, but there is no need for that person to have an account. A simple solution exists - **public File sharing**.

To make a <{term}>File<{/term}> available on a public link to external users, do the following:

<{step num=1}>Select the File that you wish to share.<{/step}>
<{step num=2}>Open <{option}>Options<{/option}> and click <{option}>Sharing<{/option}>.<{/step}>
<{step num=3}>Click the <{option}>Start Sharing<{/option}> button.<{/step}>
<{step num=4}>Choose the Expiry Date and whether to enable Comments and Attachments.<{/step}>
<{step num=5}>Enter email addresses of the people you wish to notify about the File's public link.<{/step}>

Your File is now available for comments and reviews. All the comments made on the public page will also be stored in activeCollab for the future reference.
