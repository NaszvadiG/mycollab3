*Title: Upload a New File from an Email
*slug: file-from-email

================================================================

You can use your email client to upload a new File to activeCollab by sending an email message.

<{note title="Enable Mail to Project"}>Before you start creating <{term}>Files<{/term}> via email, you need to enable <{term}>Mail to Project<{/term}>.

Open <{option}>Administration > Project Settings > Enable Mail to Project Interceptor<{/option}>. Set the value to **Yes** and select the default object that will be created when an email is sent.<{/note}>


After enabling <{term}>Mail to Project<{/term}>, copy the Project email address, which can be found in the Project Overview (eg. tutorials+m2p-9cabbf1@mail.manageProjects.com). To upload a File by sending an email message, enter the <{term}>File: File Name<{/term}> in subject line.

Remember that you need to **attach Files to the email**. All attachments are imported as separate Files in the Project's Files tab. The email body text is transfered to activeCollab as a description for all of the uploaded Files.
