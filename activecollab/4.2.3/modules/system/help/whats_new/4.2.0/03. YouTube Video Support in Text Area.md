*Title: Improved YouTube Video and Bookmark Support
*Slug: youtube-video-bookmark-support

================================================================

For quite some time now, activeCollab has been able to display <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> videos and Bookmarks, allowing you to post them in the <{term}>Files<{/term}> section. 	

In the 4.2 release, we have simplified this feature by allowing **YouTube videos and Bookmarks in all text areas across activeCollab**. 

<{note title="Compatibility Note: Files Section Update"}>YouTube Videos and Bookmarks used to be available in the <{term}>Files<{/term}> section. Since the functionality update, this is no longer possible.

After upgrading to version 4.2, **users with such assets will find them in the <{term}>Discussions<{/term}> area**. All comments will be saved as a Discussion thread. So, if you find some YouTube videos or bookmarks missing from Files, no need to worry - you will find them in Discussions.<{/note}>

<{sub}>Insert a YouTube Video<{/sub}>

You can do this anywhere - in a description box or inside a comment. To add a video, click the <{option}>Insert Image and Video > YouTube Video<{/option}> icon in the text editor. Once inserted, you will be able to view the video within the text field in activeCollab.

<{sub}>Share a Bookmark<{/sub}>

Click the <{option}>External Link<{/option}> icon in the text editor to share a link with your team. activeCollab will apply the proper formatting and notify your team members about the new link.
