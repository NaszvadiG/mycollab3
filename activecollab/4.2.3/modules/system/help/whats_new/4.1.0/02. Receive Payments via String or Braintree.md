*Title: Receive Payments via Stripe and Braintree
*Slug: stripe-and-braintree

================================================================

After having integrated Paypal and Authorize.net, activeCollab is now introducing support for two popular payment gateways - <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/">Braintree</a>.

Being the fastest growing on-line payment services, Stripe and Braintree are used by a great number of our customers and their clients. That is why integration with activeCollab <{term}>Payment Gateways<{/term}> was the next logical step. Our developers have been working hard to make this happen:
