*Title: Improved Text Editor
* Slug: redactor

================================================================

Communication is the one of the most important aspects of activeCollab. To be able to communicate with your team, you need to write down your thoughts and ideas in form of a comment or item description. We have simplified the process with our **new and improved text editor**.

<{sub}>Goodbye TinyMCE, Welcome Redactor<{/sub}>

We have been using <a href="http://www.tinymce.com/">TinyMCE</a> for a long time and it served us well, but it is time to move on. As activeCollab is evolving, the text editor has to grow with it. This is why we have decided to give <a href="http://imperavi.com/redactor/">Redactor</a> a try. 

So far, Redactor has proved to work like a charm. It supports all the functionalities of TinyMCE had and adds a few more...

<{sub}>Drag and Drop Images<{/sub}>

A very practical feature! Instead of browsing for the image, you can now simply drop it in place. Thr new text editor will do the rest:

<{image name="drag_and_drop.png"}>

<{sub}>General Performance Boost<{/sub}>

Since the new text editor is light-weight (only 112KB, compared to 328KB of the old ), you can expect a general performance boost after the upgrade. You will notice that pages in your activeCollab load faster and that comment and description forms are more accessible. 

We hope the new text editor makes working in activeCollab even more enjoyable!
