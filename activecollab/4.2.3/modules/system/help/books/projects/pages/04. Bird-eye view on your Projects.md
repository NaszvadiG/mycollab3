*Answers Common Question: Where can I see the progress of all my Projects?

================================================================

The <{term}>Timeline<{/term}> is a tool that will give you a bird's eye perspective of all of your Projects, enabling you to see the Project time frame and progress.

To access the Project timeline, open <{term}>Projects Menu<{/term}> and click the <{option}>Timeline<{/option}> tab:

The Project progress bars display the Project's start and due date, based on the start date of the first <{term}>Milestone<{/term}> and due date of the last one in that Project. The Project completion percentage is calculated based on the **open vs. completed** Task ratio in a Project.

There are a few things that you can do while you are on the Timeline page:

- <{option}>Complete the Project<{/option}> - Mark the checkbox in front of the Project name to complete it.
- <{option}>See Project Milestones<{/option}> - Use the magnifying glass icon or double click on the Project progress bar to see and manage all the Milestones in that Project.
- <{option}>Edit the Project<{/option}> - Clicking the pencil icon allows you to edit Project details.
- <{option}>Trash the Project<{/option}> - Removes the Project from the timeline and moves it to trash.
- <{option}>Go to the Project<{/option}> - Clicking the arrow icon opens the Project Overview page.
