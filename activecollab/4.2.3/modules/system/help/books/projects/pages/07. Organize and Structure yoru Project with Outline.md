*Title: Organize and Structure Your Project with the Outline
*slug: outline

================================================================

With the Outline, you can structure, edit and view a Project on one page. Click on the <{option}>Outline<{/option}> tab in the Projects menu. **All Milestones, Tasks and Subtasks are displayed in a tree structure** that you can expand or collapse:

Use the Outline when **starting new Projects** to quickly add all Milestones, Tasks and Subtasks. You can set all the details needed, such as assignee, due date, category, label, etc. To speed up the process, you can use <{option}>Keyboard Shortcuts<{/option}> to quickly navigate through Outline:

Besides structuring new Projects, you can use the Outline to **make changes to your current Projects**. Click the <{option}>Enter Mass Edit Mode<{/option}> button to drag and drop <{term}>Tasks<{/term}> from one Milestone to another. You can also check all of the items that you wish to edit and select one of the available actions:

- <{option}>Change Category<{/option}>
- <{option}>Change Label<{/option}>
- <{option}>Change Responsible Person<{/option}>

Another useful feature of the Outline tool is to have a **preview of a user's workload** by highlighting their assignments. The filter is set to display <{option}>Everyone's<{/option}> assignments, but you can change it to any user assigned to the Project.
