*Slug: milestones

================================================================

The best way to segment your Projects into a phases is to use <{term}>Milestones<{/term}>. With a start and due date, Milestones can mark important stages of a Project:

To see individual Milestone details, click the <{option}>Arrow Icon<{/option}> and you. The main reason why Milestones are so convenient for segmenting a Project, is because you can **have any number of <{term}>Discussions<{/term}>, <{term}>Files<{/term}>, <{term}>Notebooks<{/term}> and <{term}>Tasks<{/term}> filed under a Milestone** and keep all the important information related to that Project phase.

Milestones can be organized in the following ways:

- **Rescheduling** - enables you to change the start and due date of your Milestones. Drag the <{term}>Milestone Bar<{/term}> to desired date on the timeline. After confirming the new date range, choose whether to reschedule all successive Milestones or manually select some of them.
- **Reordering** - use the <{option}>Reorder<{/option}> button in the top right corner of the Milestones page to change the the order of Milestones with the same start date.
