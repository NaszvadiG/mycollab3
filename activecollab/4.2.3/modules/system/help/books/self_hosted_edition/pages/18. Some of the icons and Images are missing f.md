*Title: How do I fix missing icons and images in activeCollab?
*slug: missing-images

================================================================

After installing or upgrading, activeCollab copies all assets (images, Flash files and fonts) to <{path}>/public/assets<{/path}> folder. If some elements are missing, it usually means that the rebuild assets operation was not performed properly.

To resolve the problem, try running the <{option}>Rebuild Assets<{/option}> tool from Administration menu:

<{image name="rebuild_assets.png"}>

If that does not resolve the issue, try the following:

<{step num=1}>Connect to the server where your activeCollab is installed using an FTP or SFTP client, and navigate to the <{path}>/public/assets<{/path}> folder of your activeCollab setup.<{/step}>
<{step num=2}>Clear all subfolders in that folder.<{/step}>
<{step num=3}>Confirm that <{path}>/public/assets<{/path}> has the proper permissions (PHP can write in that folder, and it can write in the subfolder created of that folder),<{/step}>
<{step num=4}>Run the <{option}>Administration > Rebuild Assets<{/option}> tool again.<{/step}>

In case that this operation fails, the problem could be the permissions - double check step #3 of the process.
