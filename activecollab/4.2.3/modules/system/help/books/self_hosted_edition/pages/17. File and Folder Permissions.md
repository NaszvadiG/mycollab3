*Title: File and Folder Permissions
*Slug: file-and-folder-permissions

================================================================

One of the most common problem within activeCollab is file and folder permissions. If permissions are not set properly, it can result in various issues, such as:

- Appearance of blank pages when using the system:
- Users being unable to upload and attach files:
- User avatars, company logos, notebook covers or project icons not working as expected:
- Project exporter not exporting content:
- Upgrade script failing to write information about the latest version, etc.

To resolve the above issues, make sure that **PHP can write to all the folders and files listed below**. The following folders need to be writable for activeCollab to work properly:

- <{path}>/activecollab<{/path}>
- <{path}>/cache<{/path}>
- <{path}>/compile<{/path}>
- <{path}>/config/version.php<{/path}>
- <{path}>/logs<{/path}>
- <{path}>/public/assets<{/path}>
- <{path}>/public/avatars<{/path}>
- <{path}>/public/brand<{/path}>
- <{path}>/public/logos<{/path}>
- <{path}>/public/notebook_covers<{/path}>
- <{path}>/public/projects_icons<{/path}>
- <{path}>/thumbnails<{/path}>
- <{path}>/upload<{/path}>
- <{path}>/work<{/path}>
