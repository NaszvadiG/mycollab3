*Title: Test if Your Server Meets the System Requirements
*Slug: test-system-requirements

================================================================

To see if your system meets the activeCollab <{page name="system-requirements"}>System Requirements<{/page}>, you can use the **probe.php** script, designed specifically for this purpose.

Here is how to test your server:

- Download the probe.php.zip file. The script is available for download in our <a href="https://github.com/activecollab/activecollab-probe">Github repository</a>,
- Unpack and upload the probe.php file to your server,
- Run it through your web browser, 
- Optionally, you can open the probe.php file in your text editor and set the database connection parameters, in the <{option}>Database Settings<{/option}> section, at the beginning of the file. Once these parameters have been set, save the file on the server and run it again.

It will run a check of your platform and additionally try to connect to the database and see if it meets the system requirements.
