*Slug: reply-to-email

================================================================

Email notifications sent from activeCollab **support replies that are imported in system**  as a new comment. The comment is posted on the object that sent out the original email notification. If the <{page name="outgoing-mail-setup"}>Outgoing Mail<{/page}> and Incoming Mail are set up properly, this action is performed automatically.

To make sure that all of your email replies are working properly, open <{option}>Administration > Reply to Comment<{/option}>. 

The Reply to Comment helps you locate and resolve email conflicts in no time:
