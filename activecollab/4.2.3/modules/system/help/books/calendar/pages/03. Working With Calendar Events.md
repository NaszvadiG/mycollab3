*Title: Working with Calendar Events
*Slug: calendar-events

================================================================

You can use the Calendar to add custom <{term}>Events<{/term}> which do not have to be related to any of your Projects. You can schedule a meeting, mark the period when you will be attending a conference, set a days off, etc.

To create a new event, use the <{option}>New Event<{/option}> button on the <{option}>Calendar<{/option}> page, or just double click the date to schedule the event. You will be able to set the following:

- <{option}>Name<{/option}> of the event you are scheduling.
- <{option}>Calendar<{/option}> where the event will be placed. It can be your Calendar or the Calendar shared with you your co-workers.
- <{option}>All Day Event<{/option}> or the <{option}>Exact Time<{/option}> when the event will occur.
- <{option}>Start Date<{/option}> and <{option}>Due Date<{/option}> for events longer than one day.
- <{option}>Repeat<{/option}> for recurring events.

All users that you have shared the Calendar with will be able to see your schedule and events. In the Calendar setup, you can also determine if the group of users who can see your Calendar is also able to **add new events** in your Calendar.

<{note title="Shared Calendars"}>You can choose the group of users that will be able to see your Calendar and schedule. All <{term}>Events<{/term}> from your Calendar will be visible to the group that you have selected. If you have enabled other users to <{option}>Add Events<{/option}>, they will be able to create new events in your Calendar.

To display/hide a custom Calendar, click on the checkbox next to the Calendar name. It is also possible to export any Calendar as an iCalendar feed to another Calendar application.<{/note}>
