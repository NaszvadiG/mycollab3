*Title: Working with Project Requests
*Slug: project-requests

================================================================

<{term}>Project Requests<{/term}> are a feature that helps your Clients to submit new project requests. You can then discuss about that request, approve it and convert it to <{term}>Quote<{/term}> or <{term}>Project<{/term}>. To learn more about this handy feature, please read <{page name="project-requests" book="projects"}>Project Requests<{/page}> article.

Primary way for Project Requests submission is via public form that activeCollab automatically builds. All your existing or potential clients can access that form and fill it out. If that form does not work for you, you are free to create your own form and use activeCollab API for data submission.
