In case that a User is <{term}>Administrator<{/term}>, or <{term}>Project Manager<{/term}>, system will return all non-archived projects and properly populate <{code}>is_member<{/code}> flag value (when 0, Administrator and Project Manager can see and manage the project, but they are not directly involved with it).

Method: <{term}>GET<{/term}>

Example response:

<{code highlight=xml}><projects>
  <project>
    <id>1</id>
    <name>...</name>
     ...
    <is_member>1</is_member>
  </project>
  ...
</projects><{/code}>

<{sub slug="archive"}>projects/archive<{/sub}>

In case you wish to display all archived projects that this user has access to, use this command. If a User is an <{term}>Administrator<{/term}>, or a <{term}>Project Manager<{/term}>, system will return all archived projects and properly populate <{code}>is_member<{/code}> flag value (when 0, Administrator and Project Manager can see and manage the project, but they are not directly involved with it).

Method: <{term}>GET<{/term}>

Example response:

<{code highlight=xml}><projects>
  <project>
    <id>1</id>

<{sub slug="add-project"}>projects/add<{/sub}>

Method: <{term}>POST<{/term}>

Additionally you can include a <{code}>project_template_id<{/code}> variable, which should be a valid project ID and <{code}>first_milestone_starts_on<{/code}> which should be a valid date. If these variables are present, the new project will be created by using an existing project (determined by the ID that has been passed) as a template and Milestones will be properly rescheduled so the first one starts on the given date.

Example request:

<{code inline=false}>project[name]=API test project
project[company_id]=3
project[leader_id]=1
submitted=submitted<{/code}>

Response:

<{code highlight=xml}><project>
  <id>4</id>
  <name>
    <![CDATA[API test project]]>
  </name>
    ... 
</project><{/code}>

<{sub slug="projects-id"}>projects/:project_id<{/sub}>

- brief information about the <{term}>Project Leader<{/term}>,
- information about the <{term}>Client<{/term}> that this project is for,
- permissions that any logged in user has in each of the Project areas (Tasks, Files, Milestones, etc).

Method: <{term}>GET<{/term}>

Example response:

<{code highlight=xml}><project>
  <id>4</id>
  <name>
    <![CDATA[API test project]]>
  </name>
     ...
  <logged_user_permissions>
    <role> ... </role>
    <permissions>
      <milestone>3</milestone>
      <discussion>3</discussion>
      ...
    </permissions>
  </logged_user_permissions>
</project><{/code}>
