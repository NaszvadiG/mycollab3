<{note title="activeCollab Module Development Toutorial"}>This is a simple tutorial where we will show you how to create a simple module with <{term}>Home Screen<{/term}> widget included.  We will guide you trough the process one step at the time, show you screen-shots and code examples, and makes it easier for you to start a module of your own.<{/note}>

What you need to do first, when starting a new activeCollan module development, is to create a directory for the module. You should create it under a <{path}>/path/to/activecollab/custom/modules<{/path}> directory (where <{path}>/path/to/activecollab<{/path}> is full path to activeCollab on your disk). For our example we are going to create <{path}>my_reports<{/path}> directory:

<{image name="my_reports_folder.png"}>

Please note that you should place the module file in the <{path}>/path/to/activecollab/custom/modules<{/path}> and not in the <{path}>path/to/activecollab/activecollab/4.1.x<{/path}>. This will cause problems when you decide to upgrade.
