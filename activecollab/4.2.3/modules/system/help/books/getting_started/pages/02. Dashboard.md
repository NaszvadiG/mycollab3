* Title: Home Screen
* Slug: home-screen

================================================================

The first page that you see after logging in to activeCollab is the <{term}>Home Screen<{/term}>. All information relevant to you is listed here:

- <{term}>Tasks<{/term}> that you are assigned to.
- <{term}>Projects<{/term}> that you are working on.
-  <{term}>Notifications<{/term}> on the system level. 

The <{term}>Home Screen<{/term}> becomes more and more informative as you add <{term}>Projects<{/term}> and <{term}>Tasks<{/term}> that you are working on.

If you wish to complement the default information displayed on the <{term}>Home Screen<{/term}>, you can create additional <{term}>Tabs<{/term}>:

<{step num=1}>Click on the <{option}>Gear Icon<{/option}> at top of your screen.<{/step}>
<{step num=2}>Add a new tab by using the <{option}>New Custom Tab<{/option}> button.<{/step}>
<{step num=3}>Name the tab and choose the layout.<{/step}>
<{step num=4}>Add the desired <{term}>Widgets<{/term}> from the list.<{/step}>

<{note title="Quick Tip"}>A custom Home Screen <{term}>Tabs<{/term}> can also be <{option}>Set as Default<{/option}>, by using the <{option}>Settings<{/option}> option availbale on your <{term}>Profile<{/term}>. The set of Widgets that you have selected will be displayed as the first page after logging in to activeCollab.<{/note}>

This is how your <{term}>Home Screen<{/term}> can look like:
