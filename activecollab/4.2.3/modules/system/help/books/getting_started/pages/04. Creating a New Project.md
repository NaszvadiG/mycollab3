<{note title="Project Leader"}>One of the most important things that needs to be set on a new Project is the <{term}>Project Leader<{/term}>. This is the person responsible for the Project, who automatically receives notifications about all Project updates. This person will also be granted full access, regardless of their Project permissions.<{/note}>

When creating a new Project, you can also select a predefined <{page name="project-template" book="projects"}>Project Template<{/page}> from the dropdown menu.

After everything has been set up, click the <{option}>Create Project<{/option}> button. All there is left to do now, is to invite your team and start collaborating.
