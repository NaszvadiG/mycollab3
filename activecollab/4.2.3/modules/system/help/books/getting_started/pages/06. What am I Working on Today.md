================================================================

To find out what your daily assignments are, we recommend that you create an <{term}>Assignments<{/term}> Home Screen tab. Here's how you can see all your assignments on a single, easily accessible page:

<{step num=1}>Go to the <{term}>Home Screen<{/term}> page.<{/step}>
<{step num=2}>Click the <{term}>Gear Icon<{/term}>.<{/step}>
<{step num=3}>Use the <{option}>New Custom Tab<{/option}> button to add a new tab to your Home Screen.<{/step}>
<{step num=4}>Enter the new tab name (eg. My Assignments).<{/step}>
<{step num=5}>Choose the <{option}>Assignment Filters<{/option}> as the tab type.<{/step}>
<{step num=6}>In case you already have created and saved a custom filter, you will be able to select it from the <{option}>Pre-Select Filter<{/option}> drop down menu.<{/step}>

You can even set the <{term}>Assignments<{/term}> as the first page after logging in to your activeCollab, use the <{option}>Setting<{/option}> option on your Profile and set it to be your defult Home Screen tab.
