* Title: Adding People to Projects
* Slug: adding-people-to-projects

================================================================

To be able to work on your Projects with your team you need to include your co-workers to these Projects. You can even include your Clients if you wish. 

There are two ways of adding users to Projects in activeCollab:

<{sub}>1. From the User's Profile Page<{/sub}>

You can use <{option}>Options > Add to Project<{/option}> available in the <{term}>Users Profile<{/term}> to add a person to a few Projects at once. You will be able to choose Projects and <{term}>Project Permissions<{/term}> that this person will have.

This feature can come in handy when you are including a new user to your activeCollab.

<{sub}>2. From the Project Overview Page<{/sub}>

Another way of adding people to Projects is from the <{term}>Project Overview<{/term}> page. Click the <{term}>Manage Project People<{/term}> link and a new page will appear where you can use the <{term}>Add People<{/term}> button. Select the users you wish to add to this Project and the Project Permissions that they will have.
