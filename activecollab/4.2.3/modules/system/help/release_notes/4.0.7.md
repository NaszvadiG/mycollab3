First stable version of activeCollab 4. Major system improvements are:

* Color Schemes - paint your activeCollab as you wish and set the color scheme that fits your company identity.
* Notification Center - email or inline notifications, the choice is yours. Now you can configure how you wish to have your activeCollab notifications delivered.
* Project Templates - now they have their own room in activeCollab where you can easily plan your projects with all the Milestones, Tasks and Subtasks, assignees and Files that you wish to have in a project template.
* Announcements - they will help you share information with selected group of users. The info will be available at the Dashboard once users login to your activeCollab.
* Simplified User Roles - now built in and predefined, leaving you only to fine-tune additional permissions for each group of users.
* Mail to Project - turns each of your projects into a mailbox. By sending an email to a pre-defined address you can easily create a new Task or a Discussion just by using your email client.
* Brute force login protection will keep your activeCollab more secure than ever.
