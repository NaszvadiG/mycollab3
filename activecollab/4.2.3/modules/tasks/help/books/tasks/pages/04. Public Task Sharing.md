*Title: Public Task Sharing
*Slug: public-task-sharing

================================================================

You may want to show a Task to a client, but you do not wish to create a user account for them in activeCollab. We do have a solution - you can share the page link and have it available outside of activeCollab:

<{step num=1}>Visit the Task that you wish to share.<{/step}>
<{step num=2}>Open <{option}>Options<{/option}> menu and find the <{option}>Sharing<{/option}> option.<{/step}>
<{step num=3}>Click the <{option}>Start Sharing<{/option}> button in the pop-up.<{/step}>
<{step num=4}>Set the sharing as you wish by choosing the Expiry Date and enabling Comments and Attachments.<{/step}>
<{step num=5}>Enter email addresses of the people you wish to notify about the Tasks's public link.<{/step}>

The shared page will look like this:
