*Answers Common Question: Can I create new Task via email?

================================================================

activeCollab has great email integration that enables you to use email messages to create new objects in the system. You can use this integration to create a new Task right from your email client.

<{note title="Enable Mail to Project"}>Before you can start creating <{term}>Tasks<{/term}> by using email, you will have to enable Mail to Project.

Go to <{option}>Administration > Project Settings > Enable Mail to Project Interceptor<{/option}>. Set the value to **Yes** and select the default object that will be created when an email is sent.<{/note}>

When the <{term}>Mail to Project<{/term}> is enabled, all you need to do is to create a new Task in activeCollab and send an email to the address specified in the <{term}>Project Overview<{/term}> (eg. tutorials+m2p-9cabbf1@mail.manageProjects.com). Be sure to include the <{term}>Task: Task Name<{/term}> in subject line.
