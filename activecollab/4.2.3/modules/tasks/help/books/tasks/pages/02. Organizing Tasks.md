*Title: Organizing Tasks
*Slug: organizing-tasks

================================================================

Tasks in activeCollab can be organized in a way that fits you and your workflow best.

All <{term}>Tasks<{/term}> in a Project are be displayed on the left side of the screen. You can choose how you wish to sort them:

- <{option}>Filter by Status<{/option}> displays All, Open or Completed Tasks.
- <{option}>Group by<{/option}> arranges Tasks by Category, Milestone, Label, Assignee, Delegate, Priority or by preset Custom Fields.
- <{option}>Reorder<{/option}> toggles dragging and dropping Tasks on the list.

<{sub}>Label and CategorIze Your Tasks<{/sub}>

Labels and Categories are a practical solution for organizing Tasks. They are fully customizable and adaptable to your workflow.

To set the <{term}>Labels<{/term}>, go to the <{option}>Administration > Assignment Labels<{/option}> and click the <{option}>New Label<{/option}> button. You can set the **name and colors** for your labels here and create as many different labels as you need. This is also where you can edit or delete existing labels.

<{term}>Task Categories<{/term}> can be managed on the Tasks page by clicking the <{option}>Manage Categories<{/option}> link. When creating a <{option}>New Task<{/option}>, a new category can be added on the go by opening the <{option}>Category<{/option}> drop-down menu and selecting <{option}>New...<{/option}>.

<{sub}>Task History<{/sub}>

**All changes made to a Task will be tracked in activeCollab**. For example, if one of your team members edits the Task description or changes a label, the action will be logged.

You can see the complete life-cycle of every Task in the <{term}>History<{/term}> section located below the comments on the Tasks page.

<{sub}>Tasks Mass Edit<{/sub}>

To change the properties of a multiple Tasks at once, click individual Tasks while holding <{term}>Ctrl<{/term}> (Windows) or <{term}>Cmd<{/term}> (OS X). After selecting the Tasks, you can change Visibility, Status, Priority, Category, Label, or a Milestone.

Besides updating basic Task properties, you can use mass editing to move Tasks to Trash or the Archive.

<{sub}>Archiving Tasks<{/sub}>

Declutter your Task lists by moving completed Tasks to the <{term}>Archive<{/term}>. As opposed to moving Tasks to trash and permanently deleting them, **archived Tasks are stored for future reference and can be accessed at any time**.

To move a completed Task to the Archive, select it and click on <{option}>Options > Move to Archive<{/option}>. To view archived Tasks, click the <{option}>Browse Archive<{/option}> link on the Tasks page.
