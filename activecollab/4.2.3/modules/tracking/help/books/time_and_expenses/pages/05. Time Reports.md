================================================================

There are a few reports that you can generate to find out more about the time that you and your team have spent working on different Projects.

<{sub}>Estimated and Tracked Time<{/sub}>

Use this report to see how the time estimates compare with the actual logged time:

<{step num=1}>Navigate to <{option}>Reports & Filters > Time Estimates<{/option}><{/step}>
<{step num=2}>Select the Project.<{/step}>
<{step num=3}>Optionally, group the results by Assignee, Milestone, Category, Label...<{/step}>

Your report may look like this:

<{sub}>Time and Expenses Report<{/sub}>

If you have been tracking time or expenses while working on a Task or a Project, you can generate a Time and Expenses report:

<{step num=1}>Navigate to <{option}>Reports & Filters > Time and Expenses<{/option}>.<{/step}>
<{step num=2}>Choose whether to display Time, Expenses, or both.<{/step}>
<{step num=3}>Set the <{term}>Job Type<{/term}> or the <{term}>Expense Category<{/term}> to refine the report results.<{/step}>
<{step num=4}>Specify the <{term}>Day<{/term}>, the <{term}>User<{/term}> who has logged the time or expenses, the <{term}>Project<{/term}> and the <{term}>Status<{/term}> for logged time.<{/step}>
<{step num=5}>Optionally, group the results by Date, Project, or Project Client.<{/step}>

After generating the report, you can <{option}>Create an Invoice<{/option}> or export it as an Excel or a CSV File.
