After learning how to <{page name="creating-invoice"}>Create an Invoice<{/page}> and to <{page name="creating-invoice-from-time-report"}>Generate an Invoice from a Time Report<{/page}>, you can send the Invoice to your client and start receiving payments.

A newly created Invoice appear as a <{term}>Draft<{/term}>. Draft Invoices can be edited or deleted, so you can still change some of the data if you wish. To notify the client that the Invoice needs to be paid, it has to be issued.

Click the <{term}>Issue<{/term}> button on the draft Invoice. Set the <{option}>Issue Date<{/option}>, define a <{option}>Payment Due Date<{/option}>, and select whether you wish to <{option}>Notify Your Client<{/option}> about the new Invoice. By choosing to email your client, the Invoice PDF will be attached automatically.

When the client receives the Invoice PDF, they will also be able to visit the Invoice page by logging in to your activeCollab (no worries, they will only see Invoices issued to their own company). If you already have <{page name="payment-gateway"}>Payment Gateways<{/page}> enabled your Clients will be able to use <{option}>Make a Payment<{/option}> button.

<{note title="Which Payment Gateways are supported in activeCollab?"}>Payment Gateways that can be integrated with activeCollab are <a href="https://www.paypal.com/">Paypal</a>, <a href="http://www.authorize.net/">Authorize.net</a>, <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/">Braintree</a>.<{/note}>
