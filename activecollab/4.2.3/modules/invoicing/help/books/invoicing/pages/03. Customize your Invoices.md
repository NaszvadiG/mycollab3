- Use <{option}>Body Settings<{/option}> to choose the layout and font for the Client and Invoice details, toggle borders and <{term}>Invoice Item<{/term}> columns and set the appearance of <{term}>Invoice Notes<{/term}>.
- <{option}>Footer Settings<{/option}> allow you to set how the Invoice and page numbers are displayed and whether to display a footer border.

Use <{option}>Invoice Settings<{/option}> to further customize your Invoices:

- Set the **name of <{term}>Issued<{/term}> and <{term}>Draft<{/term}> Invoices**. By default they are called Invoice and Proforma Invoice.

- Enable a **Second Tax** and a **Compound Tax** if necessary.
