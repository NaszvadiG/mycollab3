*Title: Creating a Quote
*Slug: creating-quote

================================================================

<{term}>Quotes<{/term}> help you negotiate project expenses with your clients. There is no need to use an external service to send Quotes - all cost estimates can be managed from activeCollab.

There are two ways to create a Quote in activeCollab:

1. Use the <{option}>Quick Add<{/option}> tool and select <{option}>Quote<{/option}> from the list.
2. Navigate to the <{term}>Projects<{/term}> menu and click the <{term}>Quotes<{/term}> tab. You will see the <{option}>New Quote<{/option}> there.

When creating the Quote, you may **choose an existing client** who already has a company profile in your activeCollab, or **add a new client** by entering their company details. To speed up the process, you can use presets such as **sets of different <{option}>Currencies<{/option}> and <{option}>Languages<{/option}> available**, as well as predefined <{option}>Invoice Item and Note Templates<{/option}>.

<{note title="Who is listed as a contact person when I create a Quote for an existing client?"}>The contact person can only be a user with a user with <{term}>Client<{/term}> <{page name="system-roles" book="people"}>System Role<{/page}> with the <{option}>Receive and Pay Invoices<{/option}> permission enabled. In case that no one from a Client Company has this permission you will not be able to Issue that Quote.<{/note}>

After everything has been set up, click on the <{option}>Create Quote<{/option}> button to save a Quote <{term}>Draft<{/term}>. This status refers to Quotes that have not yet been sent to a client.
