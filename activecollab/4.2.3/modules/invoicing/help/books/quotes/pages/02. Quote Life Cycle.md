Clicking the <{option}>Send<{/option}> button will automatically generate a public URL which you can use to have a discussion about the Quote with the client. After you have reached a conclusion, there are a number of things that can be done with a Quote: 

- <{option}>Create Invoice<{/option}> out of the data available in the Quote and issue it to the client.
- <{option}>Mark as Lost<{/option}> in case your negotiations were unsuccessful, lost Quotes are saved and available for future reference.
- <{option}>Edit<{/option}> the Quote to make changes and notify your client about them.
- <{option}>Mark as Won<{/option}> in case you have reached an agreement with the client and plan to continue your collaboration.

Quotes marked as Won can be used to create a new project. To start a project based on a Quote, click <{option}>Convert to Project<{/option}>

When creating a project from a Quote, some information will be transfered automatically. For example, the <{option}>Quote Title<{/option}> will become a the <{option}>Project Name<{/option}>, the <{option}>Quote Note<{/option}> will be turned into the <{option}>Project Description<{/option}>, and the amount set on the Quote will applied as the <{option}>Project Budget<{/option}>.

If you wish, you can also use a <{page name="project-template" book="projects"}>Project Template<{/page}> and quickly start the project made from the Quote.
