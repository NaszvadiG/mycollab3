*Title: Start a Discussion
*Slug: create-discussion

================================================================

<{term}>Discussions<{/term}> in activeCollab can be used for making decisions, exchanging ideas, providing feedback... Just like an on-line forum or a social-media site, posts are listed chronologically, providing full insight into Discussion history.

To start a new Discussion, click on the Discussions Project tab and use <{option}>New Discussion<{/option}> link. Enter the Discussion Title and Description. You may also set the Category, Milestone and Visibility, Attach Files and Notify People.

By selecting users in <{option}>Notify People<{/option}>, they will be subscribed to the notifications about the new Discussion, as well as all subsequent comments and updates.

<{note title="Private Discussions"}>In case you need to discuss a topic with your co-workers only,  set the Visibility of that Discussion to <{option}>Private<{/option}>. By doing so, the Discussion will be hidden form the <{term}>Client<{/term}> users in your activeCollab.<{/note}>

A comment becomes locked for editing 30 minutes after being posted. Afterwards, only <{term}>Administrator<{/term}> and <{term}>Manager<{/term}> users can edit or delete it. If you wish to disable comments completely, select <{option}>Lock Comments<{/option}> in the <{option}>Options<{/option}> menu. That will prevent users from posting comments on that Discussion.
