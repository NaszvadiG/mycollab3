*Title: Organize Your Discussions
*Slug: organize-discussions

================================================================

All the Discussion made in a Project are listed under the <{term}>Discussions<{/term}> tab. 

By default, recently updated Discussions are displayed at the top of the list and are automatically marked as <{term}>Unread<{/term}>. To rearrange the Discussion list, use the <{option}>Group By<{/option}> option and sort the Discussions by Category or Milestone. The quick search bar allows you to narrow down the list according to the search criteria.

To highlight a Discussion, you may choose to <{option}>Pin<{/option}> it and make sure that it will always be displayed at top of the list. 

<{sub}>Archiving Discussions<{/sub}>

Archiving allows you to remove Discussions, which are no longer relevant. Instead of moving a Discussion to Trash and permanently deleting it, an archived Discussion is stored for future reference and can be accessed at any time.

To move a Discussion to the archive, select it and click on <{option}>Options > Move to Archive<{/option}>. To view archived Discussions, click on the <{option}>Browse Archive<{/option}> link available on the Discussions page.
