================================================================

Public Discussions are great when you have to discuss a topic with people who do not have an account in your activeCollab. Even though external users will participate in the Discussion on the public page, the entire conversation will be stored and accessible in your project management system as well.

To set a <{term}>Discussion<{/term}> that will be available on a public link, do the following:

<{step num=1}>Open the Discussion that you wish to share.<{/step}>
<{step num=2}>Open <{option}>Options<{/option}> and click <{option}>Sharing<{/option}><{/step}>
<{step num=3}>Click the <{option}>Start Sharing<{/option}> button.<{/step}>
<{step num=4}>Configure the Expiry Date and whether to enable Comments and Attachments.<{/step}>
<{step num=5}>Enter email addresses of the people you wish to notify about the Discussion's public link.<{/step}>
