*Title: Start a New Discussion from an Email
*Slug: discussion-from-email

================================================================

activeCollab works great with email. For instance, you can create a new Discussion just by using your email client. 

<{note title="Enable Mail to Project"}>Before you start creating <{term}>Discussions<{/term}> via email, you need to enable <{term}>Mail to Project<{/term}>. You can do that in <{option}>Administration > Project Settings > Enable Mail to Project Interceptor<{/option}>. Set the value to **Yes** and select the default object that will be created when an email is sent.<{/note}>

After enabling <{term}>Mail to Project<{/term}>, copy the Project email address, which can be found in the <{term}>Project Overview<{/term}> page (eg. tutorials+m2p-9cabbf1@mail.manageProjects.com). To create a Discussion by sending an email, do not forget to enter <{term}>Discussion: Discussion Title<{/term}> in the subject line.

activeCollab will create a Discussion from the email and your team will be able to post comments.
