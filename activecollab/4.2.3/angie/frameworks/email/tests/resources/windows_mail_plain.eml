The Andalusian is closely related to the Lusitano of Portugal, and has been 
used to develop many other breeds, especially in Europe and the Americas. 
Modern Andalusians are used for many equestrian activities, including 
dressage, show jumping and driving. The breed is also used extensively in 
movies, especially historical pictures and fantasy epics.

A, nisam dovoljno obratio paznju, project manager po defaultu nema people 
management, ali moze da ima i tu dozvolu.
Znaci, bice ovako: project manager moze da se uloguje kao people manager 
samo ako i project manager ima "people management", jer tad logovanjem kao 
people manager ne dobija nikakve vise dozvole od onih koje vec ima.
