The Andalusian is closely related to the Lusitano of Portugal, and has =
been
used to develop many other breeds, especially in Europe and the =
Americas.
Modern Andalusians are used for many equestrian activities, including
dressage, show jumping and driving. The breed is also used extensively =
in
movies, especially historical pictures and fantasy epics.

True at First Light is a book by American novelist Ernest Hemingway =
about
his 1953-54 East African safari with his fourth wife Mary, released
posthumously in his centennial year in 1999. The book received mostly
negative or lukewarm reviews from the popular press and sparked a =
literary
controversy regarding how, and whether, an author's work should be =
reworked
and published after his death. Unlike critics of the popular press,
Hemingway scholars generally consider True at First Light to be complex =
and
a worthy addition in his canon of later fiction. In January 1954=09

A, nisam dovoljno obratio paznju, project manager po defaultu nema =
people
management, ali moze da ima i tu dozvolu.

Znaci, bice ovako: project manager moze da se uloguje kao people manager
samo ako i project manager ima "people management", jer tad logovanjem =
kao
people manager ne dobija nikakve vise dozvole od onih koje vec ima.
