Experiments allow an easy way for developers to ship a feature, but selectively turn it on or off. This is handy when feature is close to completion, but developers need to have actual users use it and track impact on their behaviour and system reliability.

List of experiments that are running is defined in <{path}>config/config.php<{/path}> file:

<{code highlight=php inline=false}>const ANGIE_EXPERIMENTS = 'experiment_1,experiment_2,experiment_3';<{/code}>

In the code, we can easily check if experiment is running by calling <{code}>isRunning()<{/code}> method of experiments delegate:

<{code highlight=php}>if (AngieApplication::experiments()->isRunning('experiment_name)) {
  // Do something only when experiment is running
}<{/code}>

<{note title='Important'}>Experiment checks should be removed once a feature is tested and ready for production. Experiments that are running for extensive periods of time (more than a month for example) without being included in production system should be considered failed and dropped.<{/note}>
