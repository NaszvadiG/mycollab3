ElasticSearch is controlled via constants defined on <{path}>config.php<{/path}> file. Following options are available:

1. <{code}>ELASTIC_SEARCH_HOSTS<{/code}> - List of servers in <{code}>IP:PORT,IP:PORT,IP:PORT<{/code}> format,
2. <{code}>ELASTIC_SEARCH_TIMEOUT<{/code}> - Connection timeout, in seconds. If not set, default value is used (300 seconds, set by Elastica, in order to support large document handling).

Library that we use to communicate with ElasticSearch is <a href="http://elastica.io">Elastica</a>. There is not that much documentation about the API, but it is well tested and a lot can be figured out simply by reading <a href="https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/tree/master/test">tests</a>.

To get a client instance, call:

<{code highlight=php inline=false}>AngieApplication::elastica()->getClient()<{/code}>
