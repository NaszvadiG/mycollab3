  'Commands listed above are just examples. Please consult your system administrator or hosting provider for exact location of PHP or curl executables and for assistance with getting these commands to execute properly on your server',
  'On Windows you can also use Scheduled Tasks to trigger scheduled tasks in activeCollab. To set-up Scheduled Tasks on Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 (as well as Windows 2003 Server or later) you can use schtasks.exe. To do so, open the command line and type in the following commands',
